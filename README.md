First of all make sure you have the Boost library installed on your system (see more [Boost installation on Windows](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_75_0/more/getting_started/windows.html) or [Boost installation on *nix](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_75_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html));

2. Clone this project and then cd to the project folder;

3. Configure the project using CMake:
```
$ cmake -B ./build -G <preferred generator>
```

4. Then run build command:
```
$ cmake --build ./build --config <Debug|Release> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug|Release>
```

5. You've done! The builded binary file available in the build directory.

## Usage
